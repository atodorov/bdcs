Download the haskell-rpm repo.  You don't have to build it.  You do have to
remove everything from rpm.cabal after the library section.  I don't know
why yet.  Then:

$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal sandbox add-source ~/src/haskell-rpm/
$ cabal install --dependencies-only
$ cabal build
$ cabal run test -- [list of RPMs here]
